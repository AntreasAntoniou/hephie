# Development Guidelines for Hephie

This document serves as a guide for the technical development of Hephie, outlining standards, setup procedures, testing protocols, and the process for submitting changes.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (prefer the LTS version).
- Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.8 or higher is installed for script execution and testing.
- Obtain an [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and take note of the usage quotas.

### Initial Setup:
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking on the 'Fork' button.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/hephie.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd hephie`
4. Install the necessary Node.js packages: `npm install`
5. Set your OpenAI API key in your local environment variables or within a `.env` file in the project root.

## Code Standards

### Style Guide:
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- For Python, adhere to [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

### Code Linting and Formatting:
- Use ESLint for JavaScript. Run `npx eslint --init` to set up.
- Use Flake8 for Python. Install via pip with `pip install flake8` and run it with `flake8 path/to/code/`.

## Building and Testing

### Local Development Builds:
- Use Webpack or a similar build tool configured for Node.js packages.
- Run a development build and watch for changes: `npm run dev`.

### Testing:
- Write unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code.
- Use [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for Python code.
- Aim for a high code coverage, and regularly run `npm test` or `python -m unittest` to check.

## Debugging Tips
- Use VS Code's built-in debugger for stepping through code.
- Add `console.log` or `print` statements to inspect variable states and control flow.
- Check the "Problems" tab in VS Code for linting issues and potential bugs.

## Submitting Changes
- Commit changes with descriptive messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Push changes to a new branch (specific to the feature or fix) in your fork.
- Open a pull request with `main` branch of the original repository.
- Ensure all CI tests pass and your code does not decrease overall test coverage.
