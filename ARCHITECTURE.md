# Hephie Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of 'Hephie', detailing how the system's components interact with each other and the GPT-4 API. It provides a technical blueprint for the light and useful system you're aiming to create.

## VS Code Integration

- **Plugin Component:**
  - Research VS Code Extension API.
  - Draft an Extension Manifest (package.json).
  - Set up a basic Command and Message Passing structure.
  - Write handlers for context capturing: 
    - Document listener for changes
    - Selection listener for manual triggering
  - Create a routing mechanism within the extension to delegate tasks like fetch calls to GPT-4.

- **Context Sharing:**
  - Institute a serialization method for active code context.
  - Implement mechanisms to establish context relevance.
  - Create a deserialization protocol at the receiving endpoint (AI backend).

- **Command Palette:**
  - Design an intuitive Command Palette interface for user commands.
  - Establish a direct invocation pathway for extension entrants.
  - Integrate a feedback/progress indication system to show AI processing status.

## Terminal Integration

- **CLI Application:**
  - Structure the main command-line app using Node.js or Python.
  - Design a parser for terminal input arguments and flags.
  - Implement read and write functionalities to handle context and API responses.

- **Inter-process Communication (IPC):**
  - Opt for a Node.js-based IPC method for communication with the VS Code extension.
  - Secure context transfer protocols.
  - Plan for asynchronous data handling for process spawning and execution.

## Automatic Generation of Markdown Files

- **Issue Tracker Integration:**
  - Enumerate supported issue-tracking systems and outline their API requirements.
  - Craft a universal issue markdown template.
  - Develop an issue extraction module that utilizes template engines.

- **Context to Markdown Conversion:**
  - Conceive a converter utility that translates the code context/issues into markdown format.
  - Set up a system to push the markdown content to the respective issue trackers/repository.

## Summarization and Tree Structure

- **Code Parsing Module:**
  - Create a parser to break down Python files into manageable tokens.
  - Outline the summarization algorithm for constructing tree structures.

- **Inference of Change Locations:**
  - Devise an inferential system based on the summaries to suggest change locations.
  - Set up a user-feedback module to verify and improve the inferential engine.

- **Iterative Context Querying:**
  - Build upon the user-feedback loop that revises context estimations with every iteration.
  - Design a module to refine fetch calls with each succession.

## Code Improvement Commands

- **Refactoring Suggestions:**
  - Develop pattern-recognition algorithms for code smell detection.
  - Propose refactoring patterns based on recognized code smells.

- **Commenting Enhancements:**
  - Inscribe a commenting engine that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
  - Implement logic for both inline and block comments that improves code readability.

- **Docstring Automation:**
  - Synthesize a docstring generation module.
  - Integrate logic for identifying function and method borders.
